If you don't have one already, create a repository in your Git Hub account for prework. Create or modify a branch for this repository called codecademy. Create a README.md file describing the repository and the work you're putting into it. Push to this repository your code from the following CodeCademy assignments:

Unit 3: PygLatin
Unit 4: Taking a Vacation
Unit 5: A Day at the Supermarket
Unit 6: Student Becomes the Teacher
Unit 7: Battleship!
Submit a pull request to your master branch, but do not yet merge it. Copy the URL for the pull request and submit that URL to Canvas for the Prework assignment. After you do this, merge your work to your master branch.

Use the comments function in Canvas to submit questions, comments, and reflections on this work. Because this is not an HTML/CSS/JS course, those assignments will not be graded in any detail.
